## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

**Please note** that the Simulator (iPhone 6s Plus / iOS 9.1 / 13B137) may not send the appropriate `UIKeyboardWillShow` Notifications. But the Example app has been tested on a device running iOS 9.1 (13B143). 

**Also please note** that you may get the following messages on the console (which don't affect the library in any way):

    _BSMachError: (os/kern) invalid capability (20)
    _BSMachError: (os/kern) invalid name (15)
